## VERSION HISTORY

This exists to keep track of all the different versions of the GDD and the changes it was subject to. The number of the version depends on the changes made to it: if the changes are more radical, the number of changes is bigger and in the inverse. The version history is not included in the document submitted for revision to the developers because it includes dates and could be judged.

## GENERAL VISION OF THE GAME

It has to establish the vision and focus of the project that will guide it until the end. This summary has to mention the most interesting, advantages and the originality behind the game. Why would people play this game? The structure is similar to an essay, an introduction has to cover all the essential aspects while the subsequent paragraphs detail what we previously mentioned. Ultimately, a conclusion must leave the reader with the hype and expectation to play the game.
